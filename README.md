# About

StockAnalyzer is a Java program that calculates metrics related to rectangles and stocks. It allows users to input the width and height of a rectangle, calculate its area and perimeter, and input stock information like symbol, stock name, previous closing price, and current price. The program offers an interactive way to analyze geometric shapes and stock market data.

# Features

The StockAnalyzer Java program offers impressive features such as rectangle metrics, stock market analysis, and an interactive interface. Users can input the width and height of a rectangle, which calculates the area and perimeter. The program also allows users to input stock-related information such as the stock's unique identifier, stock name, previous closing price, and current price. This allows users to analyze stock performance, track changes, and make informed decisions. The program also provides an interactive interface, allowing users to input data dynamically, making it user-friendly for traders, investors, and curious learners. This versatile tool bridges the gap between geometric shapes and financial data, providing a versatile tool for both mathematical exploration and stock market insights.

# Rating

The evaluation of the project reveals several issues with code organization and readability, including inconsistent naming conventions, misspelled class names, indentation, and formatting. The program also lacks clear explanations for methods and classes, confusing variable names, and inconsistent capitalization in method names.
Functionality and completeness are good, with functions like generating pentagonal numbers, checking for palindromes, converting units, and checking passwords. However, some methods like `isValidPassword` have logical errors and are not complete. The functionality of printing meters and feet in a loop is also present.
Error handling is normal, with no handling for incorrect user input, empty or null passwords, potential divide by zero errors, or number format exceptions in the `isPalindrome` method. Efficiency could be improved in areas like redundant logic in the craps game methods, an inefficient loop in the `isValidPassword` method, no reuse of the `Random` instance in the `CrapsGame` class, and redundant calculations in the `footToMeter` and `meterToFoot` methods.
Overall, the project shows potential but requires significant improvements in various aspects to make it more robust and maintainable. Refactoring the code, addressing logical errors, and adding error handling would greatly enhance the project's quality.
